# IP Geolocalization Script

This repository contains a Python script designed to perform a geolocalization from an IP automatically. Running the script will extract data from an specific IP.

## â–¶ What is Geolocalization?
Geolocalization is a technique used to extract information from IPs'.
It is used to collect large amounts of data from an IP.

## â–¶ How does this script work?
This Python script uses several libraries such as IPinfo and Colorama.
IPinfo prides itself on being the most reliable, accurate, and in-depth source of IP address data available anywhere.
On the other hand, Colorama makes ANSI escape character sequences (for producing colored terminal text and cursor positioning) work under MS Windows.

## âž¡ How to run the script?
To run the script, you will need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you will need to install the necessary Python libraries, such as IPinfo and Coloroma. You can install these libraries using pip, the Python package installer.

Here is an example of how you can install IPinfo and Colorama:

```
pip install IPinfo
pip install Colorama
```

Once you have installed Python and the necessary libraries, you can run the Python script using the following command in the terminal:

```
python main.py
```
### ðŸ”´ Warning
Before performing IP geolocalization on any IP, be sure to not use this script with bad purposes.
